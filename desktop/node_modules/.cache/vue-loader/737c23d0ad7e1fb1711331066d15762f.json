He and Sun drawn a schedule\\n      for IBSS, and closely worked together in finding a way to stimulate\\n      animals locomotion, esp. gecko and pigeon, and by this way to understand\\n      how brain work during locomotion and how biological robot can be set up.\\n      He was acutely aware the importance of reaction force in clearly\\n      understanding the locomotion, developed 3D force sensors and set up a\\n      facility to measure the 3D reaction force and to observe the motion\\n      behaviors simultaneously.

This talk discusses the latest\\n      research results on the dynamics analysis, motion planning, and\\n      nonlinear control of the quadrotor transportation systems. Specifically,\\n      based on Lagrangian mechanics, a precise model is set up for the\\n      “twofold” underactuated aerial transportation system. Then, a\\n      time-optimal motion planning technique is proposed to generate a\\n      minimum-time trajectory in consideration of state and control\\n      constraints. Finally, some nonlinear control algorithms are designed to\\n      achieve asymptotic stability, whose performance is verified by various\\n      experimental results.\\n    '\n            )\n          ]),\n          _c(\"p\", { staticStyle: { \"text-align\": \"justify\" } }, [\n            _c(\"strong\", [_vm._v(\"Keywords:\")]),\n            _vm._v(\n              \"\\n      distributed parameter systems, static output feedback control, mobile\\n      actuator/sensor guidance, exponential stabilization\\n    \"\n            )\n          ]),\n          _c(\"p\", { staticStyle: { \"text-align\": \"justify\" } }, [\n            _c(\"strong\", [_vm._v(\"Biography:\")]),\n            _vm._v(\n              \"\\n      Yongchun Fang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the\\n      M.S. degree in control theory and application, both from Zhejiang\\n      University, P.

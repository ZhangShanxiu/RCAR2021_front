In winter, it is well known as the most coolest city in Japan. Summers in this city are generally warm but not humid. This city is surrounded by the largest national park of Japan (Daisetsuzan National Park). Near Asahikawa there are also some picturesque rolling fields of summer flowers including Furano and Biei.

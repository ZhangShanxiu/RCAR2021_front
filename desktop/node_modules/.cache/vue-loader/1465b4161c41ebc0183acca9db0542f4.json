The objective of this conference is to provide a forum \n      for researchers in robotics and real-time computing to share the latest results and to \n      explore the opportunity of research collaboration. With wide applications of robots \n      in industry and services sectors, real-time computing plays one of the major roles \n      in various topics in robotics including real-time control, human-robot interactions, \n      sensor perception and fusion, robot intelligence, etc. The scope of IEEE RCAR 2021 \n      covers research, development and applications in the dynamic and exciting areas of \n      real-time computing and robotics.</p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"phead fw-xxl text-red\">Contributed Papers:</span> \n      Original papers are solicited in all related areas of robotics, \n      mechatronics, control engineering. Full papers must be submitted \n      in PDF format prepared strictly following the requirements for \n      creating PDF documents. The conference proceedings will be submitted \n      to the IEEE Xplore® digital library.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"phead fw-xxl text-red\">Tutorials & Workshops:</span> \n      Proposals for tutorials and workshops addressing new topics related \n      to robotics and real-time computing are invited for submission to the T/W chairs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <span class=\"phead fw-xxl text-red\">Journal Publications:</span> \n      Expanded versions of the accepted and presented papers with high \n      quality will be invited for publication in the RCAR 2021 special \n      issues in the selected leading international journals.\n    </p>\n    <p\n      class=\"fw-xxl phead\"\n    >Areas and topics of contributed papers include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n    <div class=\"pl-4\">\n      <p>• robotics and intelligent mechatronics systems;</p>\n      <p>• sensing, perception and control theories and their applications;</p>\n      <p>• real-time imaging, image/video processing and their applications;</p>\n      <p>• selected frontier areas, such as soft robotics, artificial intelligence, computational biomechanics, etc, and their applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Xining, located in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is the capital of \n      Qinghai Province. Xining has good ecology and pleasant environment. With an average \n      temperature of 18.3℃ in summer, it is known as \"Cool City in the World\" and \"China's \n      Summer Capital\". Xining's multi-ethnic population, multi-religious coexistence, and \n      multi-cultural gathering have formed an open and inclusive city and a splendid local \n      customs. It is rich in tourism resources, including the famous Tibetan Buddhism holy \n      site Taer Monastery and Dongguan Mosque. It is only 150 kilometers away from Qinghai \n      Lake, the largest saltwater lake in inland China.</p>\n    <p>IEEE RCAR 2021 promises to be a great event for all participants, with excellent \n      technical and social programs.</p> -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n<script>\nimport Vue from \"vue\";\nimport Cfp from \"./../components/Body.vue\";\nimport TimeTable from \"./../components/TimeTable.vue\";\nimport { ImagePlugin } from \"bootstrap-vue\";\nVue.use(ImagePlugin);\nexport default {\n  name: \"CallForPapers\",\n  components: {\n    Cfp,\n    TimeTable,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\n.Cfp {\n  max-width: 1366px;\n  margin:auto;\n}\n</style>\n"]}]}

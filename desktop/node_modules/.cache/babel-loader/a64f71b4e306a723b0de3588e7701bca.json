He is Professor of\n        Astronautics, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics, Materials Science and\n        Engineering. He set up a theory of tribo-irreversible thermodynamics and\n        used the idea to understand coupling interaction among various factors\n        by ENTROPY. In 2000, he jointed Grob’s biological group in Institute of\n        Development Biology, Max-Plank-Institute, Tuebingen, Germany, where he\n        learned the language of biology, and got feeling that what engineers may\n        learn from biology and can do for biology.

He and Sun drawn a schedule\n        for IBSS, and closely worked together in finding a way to stimulate\n        animals locomotion, esp. gecko and pigeon, and by this way to understand\n        how brain work during locomotion and how biological robot can be set up.\n        He was acutely aware the importance of reaction force in clearly\n        understanding the locomotion, developed 3D force sensors and set up a\n        facility to measure the 3D reaction force and to observe the motion\n        behaviors simultaneously. He and his group find the different of\n        reaction force pattern when gecko moving on floor, wall, ceiling and\n        even various inclined surfaces, which greatly inspired the design of\n        gecko-mimicking robots. The technology also be used for understanding\n        the role of forelimb of frog during jumping, the behavior of locust when\n        the incline changes. At the same time, the adhesive mechanism and the\n        detaching technique used by gecko were subtly investigated; the adhesive\n        structures mimicking setae were developed by self-growing carbon\n        nanotube array technology, gecko mimicking adhesive elements and the\n        robot were developed for the applications in space and vacuum.

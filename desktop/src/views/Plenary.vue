        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        This talk first presents a novel dynamic optimization algorithm based on the technique of the restriction of the right-hand side, which can guarantee that the path constraint is rigorously satisfied over the entire continuous time horizon within finite iterations, and its extensions to optimal control of switched systems. Then it introduces several switching methods for switched dynamic systems, which are finite-time stabilization of switched p-normal systems, periodical sampled-data control and event-triggered sampled-data control of switched time-delay systems. By exploiting the structural information of the systems, it then reports several new constructive methods for nonholonomic mechanical systems, MIMO nonlinear systems with time-delay and deadzone nonlinearities, and nonlinear systems with time-varying or jumping parameters. Finally, this presentation outlooks the future work on optimal control of switched systems, closed-loop dynamic optimization, and hybrid intelligence optimization.

      <strong>Title: The Control Science under the Big Data/AI Age?</strong>
    </h4>
    <h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Professor R. E. Kalman was the founder and visionary intellectual leader of the field of mathematical system theory. His contributions to optimal control, optimal estimation and filtering, realization theory, and mathematical system theory are at the foundations of these fields. They have significantly influenced much of the subsequent developments. Their influence transcends well beyond system and control into diverse fields of engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, and others. However, there have been very significant developments in science, engineering, technology, and society in the last few decades. It is clear that change will accelerate further in the coming decades. Thus, thinking about the relevance and implications of the Kalman’s paradigm of the control theory under the big data or the AI age, that might illuminate the path of the system and control research for the future. This talk includes five parts. What is the Kalman’s Paradigm; The Challenges under the Kalman’s Paradigm the Problems We Face under the Big Data/AI Age; The Possible Solutions for the Post-Kalman Era _Taking MFAC as an example; and Conclusion.

    </h4>
    <h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the recent development of refined anti-disturbance control (RADC) methodologies for multiple disturbance systems and introduce its applications for USs and robots under complex environments. It will be shown how the RADC can realize a “green” and “immune” intelligent control strategy with both less-conservative anti-disturbance capability and energy conservation ability. RADC can further be applied to guarantee the safety and “survival” of an intelligent systems under “extreme” environments.

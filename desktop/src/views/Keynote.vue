        <strong>Title: Distributed Optimization based on multiagent systems</strong>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        In the past years, distributed optimization based on multiagent systems has received considerable attention due to its wide applications in smart grid, resource allocation and machine learning. Common features of these examples are that there is no centralized center involved and the resources, such as sensing, communication and computation, are usually connected by the networks and communicate in the local networks, which is called distributed algorithms. In this talk, I will first give some concepts related to distributed optimization and communication model. Then, I will introduce several recent works on distributed optimization. Application to economic dispatch problems in smart grids will also be discussed.

        <strong>Title: Distributed Optimization based on multiagent systems</strong>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        In the past years, distributed optimization based on multiagent systems has received considerable attention due to its wide applications in smart grid, resource allocation and machine learning. Common features of these examples are that there is no centralized center involved and the resources, such as sensing, communication and computation, are usually connected by the networks and communicate in the local networks, which is called distributed algorithms. In this talk, I will first give some concepts related to distributed optimization and communication model. Then, I will introduce several recent works on distributed optimization. Application to economic dispatch problems in smart grids will also be discussed.

        <strong>Title: Intelligent Sailing Robots Towards Marine Surface Exploration</strong>
      </h4>
      <h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        To meet the continuously increasing need in marine surface exploration, intelligent robots with long-range capability is crucial to reduce risk to human participants and increase efficiency. This talk will present the effort in intelligent sailing robots at different scales. Starting from small-size sailboats in controlled wind field, we model the propelling thrust by force polar diagram (FPD) and control the robot to enhance its mobility. To explore for long-range capability, we extend research effort to a large-size sailboat OceanVoy. Hybrid scheme combining Pseudo-Spectral (PS) optimal control on rudder and Extreme Seeking Control (ESC) on sail is developed to improve the performance. Furthermore, we enhance V-stability based control and reduce the control frequency to save energy. Around 1200km experiment is accumulated.

        <strong>Title: Task-oriented rehabilitation techniques with robot-assisted information feedback</strong>
      </h4>
      <h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
        Individuals with physical disabilities are often restricted to perform activities of daily life (ADLs). While efficacy of bilateral training has been demonstrated in improving physical coordination of human limbs, few robots have been developed in simulating people’s ADLs integrated with task-specific force field control. This study sought to develop a bilateral robot for better task rendering of general ADLs (gADLs), where gADL-consistent workspace is achieved by setting linear motors in series, and haptic rendering of multiple bimanual tasks (coupled, uncoupled and semi-coupled) is enabled by regulating force fields between robotic handles. Experiments were conducted with human users, and our results present a viable method of a single robotic system in simulating multiple physically bimanual tasks. The proposed robotic system is expected to be serving as a coordination training device, and its clinical efficacy will be also investigated. In this task, other relevant robot-assisted rehabilitation techniques will also be briefly introduced.
